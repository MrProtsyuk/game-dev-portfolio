                <p>This is the first game I had made in Unreal Engine 5! It really helped me understand how to build a playable game using an engine. I learned how to use blueprints in this game, such as logging how many projectiles there are left, firing the projectiles, and creating blueprint actors. Besides blueprints, I was able to learn the basics of lighting in unreal engine creating a small scene for the player.</p>
