                <p>This platformer is the second game that I had made in Unreal Engine 5. In this game I was able to build upon the skills of my last project and get a better understanding of blueprints as well as dip my feet into some C++ code. I was able to create C++ classes that could be used to alter the location, velocity, and rotation of certain actors within the game. Along with that, I learned how to create a 3rd person character and have them move around in the environment. Lots of fun!</p>
