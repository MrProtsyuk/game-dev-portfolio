                <p>Currently this is a small personal project that I am working on. This project is allowing me to express my creativity outside of a course work environment and make something of my own. I was able to create a night scene, mess around with the UE water system, mold a landscape with the landscape editor, and create foliage. There is still much to do such as, retargeting character animations, adding a combat system, adding NPCs, adding a quest system, and maybe a map? The skys the limit. Designing a level is loads of fun because it allows me to be percise with each item I place. </p>
