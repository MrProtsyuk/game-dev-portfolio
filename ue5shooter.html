                <p>This project is definitely the most difficult project that I have worked on. This project used a lot C++ code, which was used for the player character (health, movement, and weapon system), the AI (health, movement, behavior trees), and the UI. On top of that, I was able to learn how to use particles for the muzzle flash and add randomized audio for when the characters/Ai would fire and hit eachother or miss. This game is just something that I worked on in a course and is by no means polished but it really helped me understand the complexity that goes into working on real game. </p>
